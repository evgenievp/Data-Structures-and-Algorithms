ChatGPT thinks that if I can do those, I'm ready for python web Developer.
This is the start.

1. Basic Challenges
a) FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz."

Skills Tested:
Loops
Conditional statements
Modulo operation
Evaluation:
A classic warm-up to test logic-building skills.
Tests how well you can write clean and concise conditional logic.
b) Palindrome Checker
Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward).

python
Copy code
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    # Example input: "racecar" -> True
    pass
Skills Tested:
String manipulation
Logical thinking
Edge case handling
Evaluation:
A great exercise to learn about indexing and slicing.
Youâ€™ll practice handling edge cases (e.g., empty strings, special characters).
2. Intermediate Challenges
a) Unique Characters in a String
Write a function to determine if a string has all unique characters without using additional data structures.

python
Copy code
def has_unique_chars(s: str) -> bool:
    # Example: "hello" -> False, "world" -> True
    pass
Skills Tested:
Iteration
Boolean logic
Algorithm optimization
Evaluation:
Challenges you to think about efficient solutions without relying on built-in Python structures like set.
b) File Analyzer
Write a program that reads a text file and outputs the following:

Total number of lines.
Total number of words.
Total number of characters.
python
Copy code
def analyze_file(filename: str) -> dict:
    # Output: {'lines': 10, 'words': 50, 'characters': 300}
    pass
Skills Tested:
File handling
String operations
Dictionary usage
Evaluation:
A useful real-world problem.
Tests file I/O and basic text processing skills.
c) Basic API Consumption
Use the requests library to fetch data from a public API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and print the titles of all posts.

python
Copy code
import requests

def fetch_posts():
    # Output: List of post titles
    pass
Skills Tested:
Working with external libraries
Handling JSON data
Basic API integration
Evaluation:
A practical introduction to consuming APIs.
Prepares you for web-based applications.
3. Advanced Challenges
a) Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Build a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other.

Skills Tested:
2D arrays
Input handling
Game logic
Evaluation:
Tests problem decomposition and implementation of game mechanics.
Encourages clean code for managing the game state.
b) To-Do List Application
Create a basic command-line to-do list application where users can:

Add tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
View all tasks.
python
Copy code
class TodoApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
    
    def add_task(self, task: str):
        pass

    def complete_task(self, task_index: int):
        pass

    def show_tasks(self):
        pass
Skills Tested:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Managing lists and state
User interaction
Evaluation:
Tests basic OOP concepts.
Provides a foundation for more complex projects like web or GUI apps.
c) Basic Django Project
Create a simple Django web app with the following features:

A homepage with a welcome message.

A form to accept user input and display the submitted data.

A page showing all submitted entries.

Skills Tested:

Django basics (views, forms, models)
Routing
HTML integration
Evaluation:

Prepares you for backend development with Django.
Introduces key concepts like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and template rendering.
4. Bonus Challenge: Algorithm Practice
a) Two Sum
Write a function that takes a list of integers and a target sum. Return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

python
Copy code
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    # Example: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 -> [0, 1]
    pass
Skills Tested:
Problem-solving
Dictionary usage for optimized solutions
Evaluation:
Encourages thinking in terms of efficient algorithms.
Prepares for technical interviews.
How to Approach These Challenges
Start Small:
Begin with basic challenges to build confidence and get into a rhythm.
Iterate and Refactor:
After solving, revisit your code to improve readability or efficiency.
Seek Feedback:
Share your solutions with peers or on platforms like GitHub for feedback.
Document Your Work:
Write comments and explanations to solidify your understanding.
