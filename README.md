This repository is dedicated to improving and demonstrating proficiency in data structures and algorithms. 
It contains solved problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank and others. It also serves as a reference point for learning key concepts and applying them to solve algorithmic challenges.

Topics Covered
Sorting and Searching Algorithms
Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
Trees and Graphs
Dynamic Programming
Greedy Algorithms
Hash Maps and Sets
Divide and Conquer
Recursion

Implemented solutions are in Python now, but in the time I may upload some solutions written in other languages.
